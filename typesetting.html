		<p class="text">In England, Edmund de Waal is a celebrated potter, known for installations of impeccably <br> made vessels in soft shades of celadon or white, many of them permanently displayed in <br> places like the Victoria and Albert Museum here. But in the United States Mr. de Waal is <br> known primarily as a writer whose 2010 family memoir <span class="italic">“The Hare With Amber Eyes” <br> </span> became a surprise best seller. Despite countless rejections from publishers, it ended up <br> selling more than 1.5 million copies, has been translated into 26 languages and was recently <br> optioned for a movie.</p>
